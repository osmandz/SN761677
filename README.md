# SN761677
Design and program a simple PC controller software particularly for TV tuner module that using SN761677 PLL Synthesizer Chip. In this project, I use TV tuner module that I retrieved from old PCI TV card with part number TNF9835 and TSY2211. I2C logic signal from PC is generated using bit-banging technique by manipulating DTR and RTS pin of Serial Port (RS232).

This software may useful for testing TV tuner module (at least) or controller for TV tuner module to receive airband, weather satellite etc.
